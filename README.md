# Passport-Office-Queuing-system

Implement an 3 stage (A,B,C) queuing system which are arranged in a Cascaded design, with different Service rates for each stage. The goal is to prevent the probability for queue for the whole system, with 
queue length -k, to exceed a given threshold value (ε), for an arrival rate  lambda (λ). It also finds out the distributions of the response times of each stage.
